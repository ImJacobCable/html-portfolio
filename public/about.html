<h2>I'm an aspiring Web Developer</h2>
<p>
  Hi, I’m Jacob. A husband, dad of two, and someone making the jump from manufacturing into web development. I’ve always been
  into tech, but recently decided to turn that interest into a new career path. Right now, I’m learning the basics of
  front-end development and building the skills I’ll need to grow into a full-stack developer. When I’m not coding, you’ll
  probably find me with my family, gaming, watching football or basketball, or getting lost in a good sci-fi or fantasy
  story.
